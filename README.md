# What is This?
I started out wanting to have a working skeleton using `Typescript` and `ReactJS`. I did not want to read through
all the docs first.  So, I tried some tutorials.  It turns out that [Wilson Mock's post](https://medium.com/@fay_jai/getting-started-with-reactjs-typescript-and-webpack-95dcaa0ed33c)  fit my needs pretty well to get started.

I tagged [this initial version](https://github.com/InvisibleTech/typescript-react-webpack/tree/v0.1) so you could back back to it if further steps go awry.  My next steps involve getting changes in from  [Jack Franklin's post](https://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2017/04/react-typescript/) to use `ES6` and stricter `Typescript` settings.
